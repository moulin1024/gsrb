# Gauss-Seidel Red-Black Algorithm Benchmark

This repository contains an implementation and benchmark of the Gauss-Seidel Red-Black algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. The project aims to compare the performance of this algorithm across different hardware platforms and programming models.

## Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Implement the Gauss-Seidel Red-Black algorithm for CPU, CUDA, and HIP platforms.
2. Provide a benchmarking framework to measure and compare the performance of these implementations.
3. Analyze the scalability and efficiency of the algorithm on different hardware architectures.

## Features

- CPU implementation of the Gauss-Seidel and Gauss-Seidel Red-Black algorithms
- CUDA implementation for NVIDIA GPUs
- HIP implementation for AMD GPUs
- Benchmarking tools to measure performance across different platforms
- Flexible CMake-based build system for easy compilation on various systems

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake as its build system. To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Run CMake with your desired GPU backend:
   - For CUDA: `cmake -DGPU_BACKEND=CUDA ..`
   - For HIP: `cmake -DGPU_BACKEND=HIP ..`
   - For CPU-only: `cmake -DGPU_BACKEND=NONE ..`
4. Build the project: `make`

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the benchmark using:

I want add a preprocessor USE_CUDA or USE_HIP to switch the compilation of cuda function and hip function

Certainly! I'll modify the gauss_seidel.h file to include preprocessor directives for USE_CUDA and USE_HIP to conditionally compile the CUDA or HIP functions. Here's the updated version of the file with the necessary changes:
gauss_seidel.h
Here's an explanation of the changes:
I've kept the CPU-based functions unchanged, as they should always be available.
I've added preprocessor directives #if defined(USE_CUDA) and #elif defined(USE_HIP) to conditionally include either the CUDA or HIP function declarations.
The CUDA functions will be included if USE_CUDA is defined, while the HIP functions will be included if USE_HIP is defined.
If neither USE_CUDA nor USE_HIP is defined, only the CPU-based functions will be available.
With these changes, you can control which GPU-based functions are included by defining either USE_CUDA or USE_HIP during compilation. For example:
To compile with CUDA support: -DUSE_CUDA
To compile with HIP support: -DUSE_HIP
To compile without GPU support: Don't define either macro
This approach allows you to easily switch between CUDA and HIP implementations or use only the CPU version if needed.
In the cmake file, also add the preprocessor switch that compile the hip or cuda code

Certainly! I'll modify the CMakeLists.txt file to include the preprocessor switch for compiling either CUDA or HIP code. Here's the updated version with the necessary changes:
CMakeLists.txt
Here's an explanation of the changes:
Added a GPU_BACKEND option to choose between CUDA, HIP, or NONE (CPU-only).
Created conditional blocks for CUDA, HIP, and CPU-only configurations.
For CUDA:
Enabled CUDA language support
Added -DUSE_CUDA definition
Kept the CUDA-specific configurations (compute capability detection, etc.)
Added CUDA-specific source files
For HIP:
Added HIP package requirement
Added -DUSE_HIP definition
Added HIP-specific source files
5. For CPU-only:
No additional configurations needed
Updated the add_executable command to include ${GPU_SOURCES}, which will be populated based on the selected backend.
Added conditional linking for CUDA and HIP libraries.
Added a status message to print the selected GPU backend.
To use this updated CMakeLists.txt, you can specify the GPU backend when running CMake:
For CUDA: cmake -DGPU_BACKEND=CUDA ..
For HIP: cmake -DGPU_BACKEND=HIP ..
For CPU-only: cmake -DGPU_BACKEND=NONE .. (or omit the GPU_BACKEND option)
This setup allows you to easily switch between CUDA, HIP, and CPU-only compilations by changing the GPU_BACKEND option.
Do we need to have the definition of kernel fucntion here? If there are only been used internally within the host fucntion

You're right to question this. If the kernel functions are only used internally within the host functions, we don't need to declare them in the header file. Let's modify the gauss_seidel.h file to remove any unnecessary declarations and keep only the public interface.
Here's the updated version of the gauss_seidel.h file:
gauss_seidel.h
Explanation of the changes:
1. We've kept only the function declarations for the public interface.
The CPU versions are always available.
The CUDA and HIP versions are conditionally included based on the USE_CUDA and USE_HIP preprocessor definitions.
4. We've removed any kernel function declarations, as they should be defined and used only within their respective implementation files (e.g., gauss_seidel_cuda.cu or gauss_seidel_hip.cpp).
This approach has several benefits:
It keeps the public interface clean and focused on what the user of the library needs to know.
It hides implementation details (like kernel functions) from the user.
It allows for more flexibility in the internal implementation of the CUDA and HIP versions without affecting the public interface.
Remember to keep the kernel function definitions and any other GPU-specific helper functions in their respective implementation files:
For CUDA: in gauss_seidel_cuda.cu
For HIP: in gauss_seidel_hip.cpp
This way, the kernel functions and other GPU-specific details are encapsulated within their respective source files and are not exposed in the header.
How can I make it a git repo and push to my gitlab?

Here's a step-by-step guide to create a Git repository for your project and push it to GitLab:
Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:
Bash
Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
Bash
Add the following content to .gitignore:
.gitignore
Add your project files to the Git repository:
Bash
Commit the changes:
Bash
Go to GitLab and create a new project. GitLab will show you the URL of your repository.
Add the GitLab repository as a remote:
Bash
Push your local repository to GitLab:
Bash
If you're using a more recent Git version or prefer the new default branch name:
Bash
9. If you're prompted for credentials, enter your GitLab username and password or use a personal access token.
Now your project should be pushed to GitLab. You can verify this by visiting your GitLab project page.
Additional tips:
If you want to create a README file for your project on GitLab, you can create a README.md file in your project root before pushing:
Bash
If you want to add a license to your project, you can create a LICENSE file and add it to your repository before pushing.
Remember to commit and push your changes regularly as you continue to work on your project.
Create a readme.md file that introduce the purpose of this repo as benchmarking Gauss-Seidel red-black algorithm

Certainly! I'll create a README.md file that introduces the purpose of your repository for benchmarking the Gauss-Seidel red-black algorithm. Here's a template you can use:

./gauss_seidel


The program will run the Gauss-Seidel and Gauss-Seidel Red-Black algorithms on various problem sizes and report the performance metrics.
